1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.

    1) Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed 
    2) Manually run them locally before pushing code
        - I believe that the automated tests should be run locally before pushing because Githun actions should be primarily that the code doesn't break everything. The functionality of code should be tested beforehand.
    3) Run them all after all development is completed

2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)
    - yes
